              Hey! I’m Thomas Jervey, a passionate game designer, programmer and teacher.
              You can often find me working on one of my many projects or testing them for bugs in my free time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">
            My programming journey officially kicked off when I began to reverse-engineer code from free models I took off Roblox’s marketplace. Using my newfound knowledge I managed to put together a game that I thought was pretty good. 10 more years of working on games in my free time however, has taught me that it wasn't.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            While I may come to a similar conclusion in another 10 years, I’m proud to show off some of my more recent projects and I’m eager to add more to the list!
